Ap Lang Notes: Context

Your AP readers may have different backgrounds and stuff. 


You might get people who do not understand YOUR world. 

As in, do not refer to evidence with the assumption that your reader understands
all of it. 

This is because realistically, they might not. 



A little explanation will mostly suffice. 

***EX***


	"Like when Messi was signed to FC Barcelona..."

	"Like when international soccer superstar Lionel Messi signed a contract with 
	the soccer team, FC Barcelona" 


You might get people who understand, but you might also get people who struggle.
