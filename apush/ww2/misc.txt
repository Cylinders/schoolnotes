MISCELLANEOUS NOTES FROM OTHER DAYS THAT I COULD NOT FIT IN:


MISCELLANEOUS


So, after the war is over, some things are signed. 


The most importnat of which being the Geneva Convention, which we all know and lov today. 


Cold war is now practically initiated. 


The Dropping of the Atom Bombs now set the stage for the future as wars could never be fought at this scale. 

In order to fight like this, humanity would have to end itself. 



America emerged as the most powerful nation now. There was no true competition to them. 


Europe was ravaged by war. japan was burnt to glass. The only thing left was the United States. 



Now, the Cold war and the nuclear warfare would set up the world that we live in today. Crazy stuff, right? !
