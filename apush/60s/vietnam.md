Allegedly, a US gunboat is fired upon in the Gulf of Tonkin. 

Tonking Gulf resolution: 

	- Johnson uses this to go before Congress. 
	- They pass the Tonkin Gulf Resolution. 
	- Gave johnson the authority to use all necessary measures to wage war in Vietnam. 
	- We never really know what happened in the Gulf of Tonkin.

Most of the fighting was in South Vietnam, not in the North. 


Over the next three years, under President Lyndon Johnson, 

	- ** WE WILL INCREASE TROOPS OVER EACH YEAR OF PRESIDENCY **
	
	- More and more American troops, eventually 500,000
	
	- Gradual Escalation of forces from "Military Advisors" to like straight up war. 
	
### Who are we fighting? 

	- North Vietnamese Army
	- Vietcong: South Vietnamese people fighting against their own government. 
	
	- America had a lot of issues fighting with this guerilla war. 
	
	- They knew that they could not directly combat the American Trops. 
	
	- The guerilla wins if he does not lose, the conventional army loses if it does not win. -- Mao Zedong. 
	
	- US ARMY and SOUTH VIETNAMESE ARMY are allies. 
	
## One of the reasons the North/Vietcong were succesfull: 

	- Ho Chi Minh TraiL: 
	
		- Network of secret trails to help the Northerners support the Vietcong. 
		
		- Part of the bombing strategy was to figure out how to take out this trail, but it never succeeded. 
		
		
	- Vietcong had a system of tunnels and trenches throughout the country. 
	
	
	- Americans were so powerful and mighty but not quick enough to take on the Viet Cong. 
	
		- Vietcong knew how to frustrate US by being a huge thorn in their side 

# The Ground War: 

	 - The US army had a good kill ratio: 
	 
		- THE US tried to run a ** WAR OF ATTRITION **
		
			- The American Public were weary of the time that it would take to accomplish this.
			
			- Because we were fighting a nontraditional army, we were using incredibly agressive tactics. 
			
			- Missions Codenamed: Search and Destroy: 
			
				- Just searching into Villages and Destroying any potential enemies/agressors. 
				
				
	- The war was fought in a cruel manner.  
	
	- South Vietnam was transformed violently. 
	
	- Engineers start building harbours, roads, communications. 
	
	- 1 Million tons of supplies coming in every year by the end of the war. 
	
# AGENT ORANGE: 


	- Series of Rainbow Herbicide including Pink, Blue, etc. 
	
	- The US Military tried to defoliate teh South Vietnamese Country side. 
	
	- Scorched earth fighting is usually done with fire, not chemical. 
	
	- Tactical chemical warfare is a huge risk. 
	
	
	- Agent Orange contains TCDD, the most toxic Dioxins. 
	
	- Vietnam Veterans felt huge effects from Agent Orange Exposure. 
	
	
	- 2 Million Cancers and 1.5 million birth defects: 
	
		- All from Agent Orange. 
		
	- Living Room War: 
	
		- body COunts on Tv
		
		** TV WAR! **
		
		- America keeps saying: GOING WELL, WE ARE WINNING!

		- A lot of people now do not believe what the government tells them.
